# Social Interaction Simulator Game for 2024 SCU Hack for Humanity

## Inspiration
Many children face challenges in developing crucial social skills which are crucial for personal growth and success, especially after the pandemic. We wanted to create a fun and interactive way for children to practice these skills in a safe environment, where they can learn from their mistakes without the fear of rejection, gaining confidence for their interactions with real people. Our goal is provide a new resource for parents and providers for their children if they need to improve these skills.

## What it Does
Social Sim allows individuals that struggle with communication to practice while receiving feedback, allowing them to improve their communication skills without risk of rejection. We accomplish this by providing the user with a prompt generated by the OpenAI API, then having a short conversation with them based on their responses. After the end of the conversation, the program uses the messages sent by the user to grade how well they performed in the conversation, and provides them suggestions if anything they said during the conversation came off as strange or offsetting. 

## How We Built It
At the beginning of the hackathon, we made a list of tasks that were appropriate for the current stage of the project and kept it updated so that anyone not currently occupied would have some idea of what they could work on. As the day progressed, we gradually moved on from entirely separated front and backends to integrating the two together to produce our final product. 

## Challenges
While creating Social Sim, we struggled with version control and learning new JavaScript concepts such as promises and async/await.None of us had much JavaScript experience coming in, so we had to learn on the fly through trial and error. Another aspect we struggled with was the layout and design of the game UI. We had to strike a balance between spending time on frontend elements, like the chat box and animations, and making sure the backend worked properly. 

## Accomplishments
- Integrated OpenAI API backend with Phaser game engine frontend 
- Created grading system for user's responses, and provide them with suggestions
- Utilized Phaser's UI elements and animations to create a smooth user experience

## What We Learned
All of us working on the project learned a lot about how to use git and got a decent grasp of how JavaScript works, especially the asynchronous aspects of the language. We also learned how to split up tasks between frontend and backend so that we could collaborate more efficiently, which most of us were not familiar with before the event. The division of tasks also resulted in much cleaner and more manageable code, which is a good paradigm to follow for future endeavors. 

## What's Next for Social Sim
Going forward, we would like to add more levels to the game to train users to tackle more complex conversations about deeper topics. Other than additional features, we also aspire to modify our backend to be more scalable and ship the product.
