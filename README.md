# Social Interaction Simulator Game for 2024 SCU Hack for Humanity

## Inspiration
In a world increasingly driven by digital interactions, our project aims to bridge the gap between technology and human connection. Inspired by the potential of AI to simulate complex social dynamics, we embarked on creating a platform that not only entertains but also educates users on the nuances of social interactions.

## What it Does
Social Sim is a web-based application that immerses users in various social scenarios, leveraging AI to create dynamic, responsive interactions. Players navigate through different levels, each designed to simulate real-world social situations, enhancing empathy, understanding, and social skills.

## How We Built It
Utilizing Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Phaser our application is structured to be both robust and responsive. Integration with the OpenAI API allows us to incorporate advanced AI functionalities, making each interaction within the game unique and insightful.

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Phaser, Express
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API
- **Database**: Git

## Challenges We Ran Into
Integrating AI to simulate realistic social interactions proved challenging, requiring fine-tuning to balance educational value with engaging gameplay. Ensuring responsiveness across devices also demanded meticulous front-end development.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Successfully integrating OpenAI's powerful AI models to drive realistic social simulations.
- Creating an intuitive, engaging user interface that makes learning about social interactions fun and accessible.
- Developing a scalable, modular architecture that can be easily expanded with more scenarios and functionalities.

## What We Learned
This project was a journey in understanding AI's potential and limitations in simulating human behavior. We gained invaluable experience in full-stack development, AI integration, and the importance of thoughtful design in educational technology.

## What's Next for Social Sim
Looking ahead, we plan to expand our scenario library, incorporate more complex AI-driven interactions, and explore partnerships for educational use. Our goal is to make Social Sim a tool for empathy and understanding in our digital age.
